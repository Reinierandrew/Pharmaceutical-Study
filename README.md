In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. 
Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare 
the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

TOP LEVEL SUMMARY

The study looked at 10 regimens treating a total of 249 mice evenly distrubuted between male and female.
All mice started with the same tumour volume !

The regimens Capomulin and Ramicane are the most promising with Ramicane showing slightly better results for
tumour size reduction. Capomulin has a slightly higher correlation between weight and average tumour size 
suggesting a slightly better regimen for smaller mice.

The average reduction for both regimens was about 20% at the end of the study.
The best results for both regimens showed about 50% reduction in the tumour volume at the end of the study.

The remaining 8 regimens showed increased tumour volumes during the study and don't appear to have any 
positive effect on mice.
